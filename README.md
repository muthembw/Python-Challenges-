# 🌍 Python Challenges: Making Coding My Hobby

Welcome to my daily Python Challenges series! 👩🏽‍💻✨

This is a personal coding journey where I take on small but meaningful challenges every day to sharpen my Python skills and transform coding into a daily habit that sparks joy and dopamine. By sharing my progress, I hope to stay consistent, inspire others, and build a solid foundation in different programming languages — starting with Python.

I'll be uploading challenges regularly. Follow along to see how long I can keep the streak alive and how much I improve. 💪🏽

## 📍 Challenge #1: Guess the Country

**Date:** August 8, 2025
**Tags:** `Python - Intermediate`, `Computer Science`, `Solved`, `Quiz Game`

### 🎯 Objective
Create a quiz game in Python where the player guesses the name of a country. The twist? They can only see the **first letter** of the country at the start.

### 🧠 Game Mechanics
- If the player's guess is **incorrect**, reveal the next letter of the country’s name.
- The score is based on the number of **hidden letters remaining** when the correct guess is made.
- The game loops through **10 different countries** per round.
- At the end, display the player's **total score**.

### 🌟 Bonus Feature
A **leaderboard** has been added!  
Player names and scores are stored in a `.csv` file to keep track of top performers.
