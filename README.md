# 🌍 Python Challenges  

## ✨ Empowering Learning through Interactive Coding Challenges  

Welcome to my **daily Python Challenges series!** 👩🏽‍💻✨  
This is my personal coding journey where I tackle small but impactful challenges every day to sharpen my Python skills, develop problem-solving habits, and build practical projects.  

By sharing my progress, I aim to stay consistent, inspire others, and grow my portfolio of projects that highlight real-world programming concepts. 🚀

## 📍 Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **Python mini-projects** designed as hands-on challenges.  
Each challenge focuses on **one or more core programming principles** such as:  

- Loops & conditional logic  
- String manipulation & regex  
- Functions & modular design  
- File handling & CSV storage  
- Data validation & security basics  
- GUI & visualization with Tkinter/Streamlit  

Think of it as a roadmap: every challenge builds upon the previous one, reinforcing problem-solving skills while adding new tools to the toolbox.  


## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 🔑 Prerequisites  
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed  
- Basic knowledge of running scripts from the command line  

### 💻 Installation  
Clone the repo and navigate into it:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muthembw/Python-Challenges-.git
cd python-challenges
###▶️ Usage
Run any script with:
python scriptname.py
🧪 Testing
Each challenge runs independently.
Some will display outputs directly in the console.
Others (like the clock or DNA analyzer) open an interactive GUI/web app.
