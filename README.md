# 🌍 Python Challenges  

## ✨ Empowering Learning through Interactive Coding Challenges  

Welcome to my **daily Python Challenges series!** 👩🏽‍💻✨  
This is my personal coding journey where I tackle small but impactful challenges every day to sharpen my Python skills, develop problem-solving habits, and build practical projects.  

By sharing my progress, I aim to stay consistent, inspire others, and grow my portfolio of projects that highlight real-world programming concepts. 🚀

## 📍 Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **Python mini-projects** designed as hands-on challenges.  
Each challenge focuses on **one or more core programming principles** such as:  

- Loops & conditional logic  
- String manipulation & regex  
- Functions & modular design  
- File handling & CSV storage  
- Data validation & security basics  
- GUI & visualization with Tkinter/Streamlit  

Think of it as a roadmap: every challenge builds upon the previous one, reinforcing problem-solving skills while adding new tools to the toolbox.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 🔑 Prerequisites  
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed  
- Basic knowledge of running scripts from the command line  

### 💻 Installation  
Clone the repo and navigate into it:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-challenges.git
cd python-challenges
###▶️ Usage
Run any script with:
python scriptname.py
🧪 Testing
Each challenge runs independently.
Some will display outputs directly in the console.
Others (like the clock or DNA analyzer) open an interactive GUI/web app.

🧩 Challenges
🗺️ Challenge 1: Country Guess Game (country.py)
Core Principles: Loops, string manipulation, conditionals, CSV file handling
Description: Guess the hidden country name with hints revealed one letter at a time.
Bonus: A leaderboard stored in .csv keeps track of top scores.

🔐 Challenge 2: Cybersecurity Quiz (CyberSec.py)
Core Principles: Lists & dictionaries for Q&A, control flow, scoring logic
Description: A fun multiple-choice quiz that tests cybersecurity knowledge.
Replayability: Play multiple rounds and track your performance.

⏰ Challenge 3: Digital Clock (DigitalClock.py)
Core Principles: GUI design (Tkinter), time/date libraries, infinite loops
Description: Displays a real-time digital clock with both time and date in a styled interface.

🧬 Challenge 4: DNA Sequence Analysis (dnaSequence.py + dna_streamlit_app.py)
Core Principles: String operations, pattern recognition, file input/output
Description: Analyze DNA sequences  count nucleotides, create complementary strands, calculate GC content, and translate codons.
Bonus: Built a Streamlit roadmap app to visualize DNA analysis step-by-step interactively.

🌐 Challenge 5: IP Checker (ipChecker.py)
Core Principles: Regex validation, input parsing, networking basics
Description: Validates whether an entered IP address is correctly formatted (IPv4/IPv6).

🔑 Challenge 6: Password Strength Checker (password.py)
Core Principles: Regex, string validation, security concepts
Description: Validates password strength based on rules like length, uppercase/lowercase, digits, and special characters.

📌 Summary
This repo is my growing library of Python problem-solving projects.
Each challenge reinforces coding principles, introduces new tools, and showcases practical problem-solving.

What started as small exercises has become a structured journey toward real-world software skills.
And this is just the beginning. More challenges are on the way! 🌟
